Since October 2017 I am a PhD student at the Machine Learning Group in Freiburg under the supervision of 
[Frank Hutter](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~hutter) and [Marius Lindauer](https://www.tnt.uni-hannover.de/staff/lindauer/).
Before that I completed my master and bachelor degrees in computer science at the University of Freiburg.

I am interested in all facets of artificial intelligence. My research focuses on new ways to control the behavior of algorithms online. More precisely my research areas include:

  *  Dynamic Algorithm Configuration
  *  Learning to Learn
  *  (Deep) Reinforcement Learning
  *  Bayesian Optimization
  *  Automated Hyperparameter Optimization

I am a subgroup leader in [Reinforcement Learning](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/focus-groups/reinforcement-learning/) at the University of Freiburg's Machine Learning Lab, headed by Prof. Frank Hutter. My research focuses on artificial intelligence, particularly automated reinforcement learning and algorithm configuration. I specialize in generalisability of reinforcement learning as well as using reinforcement learning for dynamic algorithm configuration to optimize performance.

I completed my education at the University of Freiburg, earning my B.Sc. (2015) and M.Sc. (2017) in Computer Science. In October 2022, I received my Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) under the joint supervision of Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter and Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer (Leibniz University Hannover), with a thesis on <a href='https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022_Dissertation_Andre_Biedenkapp.pdf'>Dynamic Algorithm Configuration by Reinforcement Learning</a>.

I lead the [Reinforcement Learning subgroup](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/focus-groups/reinforcement-learning/) at the University of Freiburg's Machine Learning Lab, where I develop algorithms that learn generalist policies. My research has been recognized with best paper awards at GECCO and AutoML, and my work on Dynamic Algorithm Configuration has pioneered new approaches for adaptive algorithmic systems.

**Affiliations:**
- Member of [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)<BR>(European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems)
- Co-Founder of [AutoRL.org](https://autorl.org/)
- Chair of [COSEAL.net](https://www.coseal.net/)


I completed my education at the University of Freiburg, earning my B.Sc. (2015) and M.Sc. (2017) in Computer Science. In October 2022, I received my Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) under the joint supervision of Prof. Dr. Frank Hutter and Prof. Dr. Marius Lindauer (Leibniz University Hannover), with a thesis on <a href='https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2022_Dissertation_Andre_Biedenkapp.pdf'>Dynamic Algorithm Configuration by Reinforcement Learning</a>.

I'm happy to contribute to this years [AutoML conference](https://2024.automl.cc/) with a workshop paper and a tutorial. The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05789) discusses how to exploit structure in the configuration space for DAC by RL.
The tutorial will be held jointly with [Theresa Eimer](https://theeimer.github.io/) on AutoRL. Looking forward to seeing you there!

[Meta-learning Population-based Methods for Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d9htascfP8) has been accepted in TMLR. We address the slow start problem in Population-Based Bandits (PB2) by developing novel meta-learning approaches that leverage knowledge across environments while adapting to the time-varying nature of reinforcement learning optimization. Our best approach, MultiTaskPB2, demonstrates superior anytime and final performance across diverse RL benchmarks.

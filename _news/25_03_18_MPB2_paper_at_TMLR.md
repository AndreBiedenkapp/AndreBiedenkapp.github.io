[Meta-learning Population-based Methods for Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=d9htascfP8) has been accepted in TMLR. We address the slow start problem in PB2 with novel meta-learning approaches that leverage cross-environment knowledge. Our MultiTaskPB2 demonstrates superior performance across diverse RL benchmarks.

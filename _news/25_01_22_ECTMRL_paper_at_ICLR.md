Our paper "Efficient Cross-Episode Meta-RL" introducing ECET (Efficient Cross-Episodic Transformers) was accepted at ICLR 2025. ECET introduces a novel hierarchical transformer architecture for meta-reinforcement learning that significantly improves generalization capabilities while maintaining efficient meta-training. The paper demonstrates superior performance across MuJoCo, Meta-World and ManiSkill benchmarks.

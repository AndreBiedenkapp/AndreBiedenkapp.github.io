Our research on improving zero-shot generalization of world models for Contextual RL has been accepted at the inaugural
[Reinforcement Learning Conference (RLC)](https://rl-conference.cc/index.html). You can find the preprint of the paper
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10967). You should also check out Sai's twitter thread on the paper [here](https://twitter.com/sai_prasanna/status/1791121630187454596).

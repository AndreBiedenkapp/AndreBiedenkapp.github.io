We have two new workshop papers tackling **AutoRL** accepted at <a href="https://meta-learn.github.io/2022/">MetaLearn@NeurIPS'22</a>:<BR>
* <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=RyAl60VhTcG">AutoRL-Bench 1.0</a> introduces a tabular benchmark that enables very fast, fair, and reproducible experimental protocols for comparing future HPO methods for RL.<BR>
* <a href="">Gray-Box Gaussian Processes for Automated Reinforcement Learning</a> introduces a novel gray-box Bayesian Optimization technique for HPO in RL.

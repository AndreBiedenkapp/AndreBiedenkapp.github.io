 Our paper "[On the Importance of Reward Design in RL-based Dynamic Algorithm Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20265)" has been accepted at GECCO 2025. We demonstrate how adaptive reward shifting overcomes scalability issues in DAC, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer training steps when controlling the (1+(λ,λ))-GA algorithm.

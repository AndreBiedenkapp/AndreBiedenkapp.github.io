I'm co-orgainzing the [AutoRL Workshop](https://autorlworkshop.github.io/) at ICML 2024. The workshop will be held on July 26th or 27th (to be confirmed). The workshop will feature invited talks, contributed talks, and a poster session. The call for papers will be out soon. I'm looking forward to seeing you there!
